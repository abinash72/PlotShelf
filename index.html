                river, after you are inside it?" and started laughing out loud.

                He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the
                Grasshoppers. It was such a joyful song that his pleasure-loving
                heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did. "What is it?"
                he asked very respectfully, "that has given you such beautiful
                voices? Is there any special food you eat or is it some divine
                nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully?" "Yes," said the
                Grasshoppers, who were very fond of jokes, "it is the dew we
                drink! Try some and see." So thereafter the Ass would eat
                nothing and drink nothing but dew. Naturally, the poor foolish
                Ass died.
